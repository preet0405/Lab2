🚀 How to Use
Open index.html in your browser.

Wait for the message: "Cat data loaded. Ready to use!"

Use the buttons to explore the cat info:

Click All Names to list cat breeds

Enter a number and click Filter to find cats with that many health issues

Choose a weight unit and click Weight

Click Intelligence - Friendly to compare

I have used "Stackoverflow" for the fetch function, filter function and a little hint for average function.
